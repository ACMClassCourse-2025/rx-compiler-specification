# Publication validation

This working specification defines the language and execution contract for the
2026 course. Publication requires the following integration checks against the
selected frontend and execution environment.

## Remaining publication work

| Area | Validation | Reference |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Parser integration | Parse the documented type, item, expression, and statement forms, including lifetime declarations/arguments/bounds, nested containers, explicit turbofish, contextual punctuation, and condition/statement boundaries | [Grammar summary](grammar-summary.md), [Parser conventions](grammar.md) |
| Runtime integration | Execute Box/Vec construction, growth, non-Copy remove, nested and recursive Clone/equality, and fresh heap state for each execution with the published runtime and pinned REIMU commit | [Heap](heap.md), [Backend contract](backend.md) |

The allocator ABI, reference `Vec` growth policy, memory and stack settings, and cumulative heap budget are specified by the [backend resource guarantees](backend.md#resource-guarantees). The execution environment reclaims heap storage after each execution; source ownership and reference validity follow the [heap cleanup rules](heap.md#heap-cleanup).

## Specification status

The table of contents defines the complete course language. Documentation generation checks its structure and grammar; the integration work above checks the selected parser and runtime. Course assessment, submissions, and scoring are recorded separately.
